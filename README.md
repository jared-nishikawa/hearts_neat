# Hearts
## NEAT (neuroevolution of aumenting topologies)

The goal here was to make an AI that could play Hearts at a decent level.  I have two brothers and we like to play Hearts, but the game requires four people to play.  I was hoping to use this project to learn more about NEAT and Python's neat module.

While I did learn, I didn't end up creating a very strong Hearts AI (yet).
